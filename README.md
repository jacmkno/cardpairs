#Smartopairs
A digital board for challenging your memory and math skills. Expand the concept of matching pairs of cards to improve connections in your brain for arithmetic, practice English listening, or just improve your mental capacity.

#A safe toy for small kids and toddlers
Children can use their memory, entertain themselves with sounds, and practice math concepts according to their level. The playing space occupies the entire screen and includes only the necessary functions to avoid accidental game closures. For the little ones, you can set it up to your liking and leave a prepared board for the child to play with.

#A free board to use in group or solitary play
The game is designed as a free board with no limits on the gameplay, allowing you to be creative. Place it on a tablet on your dining table, take turns picking pairs of cards, award points to whoever discovers a pair, and the person who gets the most pairs wins!
