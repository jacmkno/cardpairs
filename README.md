**It's just a card pairing game**

- Started with the idea of playing with the family
- Decided to use UNICODE icons
- Started adding features as needed
- Can be used to practice english
- Disabled as many browser featurers as possible to prevent kids from getting undesired experiences like zooming, changing settings by mistake, translation menus, etc...
- The idea is to turn this into a payed app just for the sake of it... Doesn't maatter if you clone it, it's still open source...
